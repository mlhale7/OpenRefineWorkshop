# OpenRefine Workshop

This repository contains files and instructions for an OpenRefine workshop held on Tuesday February 16th, 2020 as part of the University of Tennessee Libraries Open Sandbox Series. Please either open a GitHub issue or email mhale16@utk.edu if you have any questions.

Before the session, please [download OpenRefine 3.4](http://openrefine.org/download.html). Note Mac users may need to go to “Security & Privacy” in their System Preferences to allow your machine to open the program. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions#macos) for further details. If you are using a Windows computer, you will need to download Java for the application to work. You can select the Windows kit with embedded Java to streamline the installation process.

Some example data sets for exploration are provided within this GitHub repository, but participants are encouraged to bring their own data for projects they are currently pursuing.
