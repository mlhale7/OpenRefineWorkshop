# OpenRefine Workshop

This repository contains files and instructions for an OpenRefine workshop run at the University of Tennessee Libraries. Please either open a GitHub issue or email mhale16@utk.edu if you have any questions.

Before the session, please [download OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html). Note Mac users may need to go to “Security & Privacy” in their System Preferences to allow your machine to open the program. Follow [these instructions](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/installing#install-or-upgrade-openrefine) for further details. If you are using a Windows computer, you will need to download Java for the application to work. You can select the Windows kit with embedded Java to streamline the installation process. For more information on installing, see "Recipe 1 - installing OpenRefine" in the ebook [Using OpenRefine](https://utk.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01UTN_KNOXVILLE/9go8o8/cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781783289097)(Accessible to UTK patrons).

Some example data sets for exploration are provided within this GitHub repository, but participants are encouraged to bring their own data for projects they are currently pursuing.
